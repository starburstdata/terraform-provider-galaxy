## Schema

### Required

- `catalog_id` (String) - A catalog

- `schema_id` (String) A schema from a catalog

### Read-Only

- `category_counts` (Attributes List) Counts grouped by category (read only) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--category_counts))
- `daily_summaries` (Attributes List) Summaries for each day (read only) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--daily_summaries))
- `severity_counts` (Attributes List) Counts grouped by severities (read only) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--severity_counts))
- `table_summaries` (Attributes List) Summaries per table (read only) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--table_summaries))
